# 🏆 Home Advantage in FIFA World Cups: Myth or Measurable Reality?

## 📌 Project Overview

Does hosting the FIFA World Cup significantly increase a country's chances of success?

This project explores the historical performance of World Cup host nations from 1930 to 2022, analyzing whether the so-called "home advantage" has persisted over time — or if it has diminished in the modern era.

---

## 🎯 Research Questions

- How often have host nations won the World Cup?
- How frequently do hosts finish in the top 3?
- Has host advantage declined after tournament expansion (post-1986)?
- Is there evidence of structural changes in competitive balance over time?

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains tournament-level information:

- Year
- Host
- Champion
- Runner-up
- Third Place
- Number of Teams
- Matches Played
- Goals Scored
- Average Goals per Game

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Data cleaning and standardization
2. Feature engineering (Host Success Level variable)
3. Era-based comparison:
   - Pre-1986 (smaller tournaments)
   - Post-1986 (expanded format)
4. Comparative analysis of host performance
5. Contextual interpretation of historical trends

---

## 🔎 Key Findings

- Hosts won approximately **27.3%** of all tournaments historically.
- Host nations reached the top 3 in **50.0%** of tournaments.
- The advantage was significantly stronger before 1986.
- Modern tournaments show a clear decline in host dominance.

This suggests that globalization, professionalization, and tournament expansion may have reduced structural home advantage.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Dataset is aggregated at tournament level.
- No match-level or team-level performance data.
- No control for FIFA rankings or squad strength.
- Small sample size (World Cups occur every four years).

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add match-level dataset.
- Include FIFA ranking prior to tournament.
- Perform statistical significance testing (Chi-square).
- Build interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Tableau).

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
